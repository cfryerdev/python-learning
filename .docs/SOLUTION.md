## Directory and File Descriptions

### Root Directory

*   **README.md**: Provides essential information about the project, including setup instructions, how to run the application, and an overview of its purpose.
*   **main.py**: The entry point for the FastAPI application. It initializes the FastAPI app instance, includes the API routers, and can configure global middleware or event handlers.
*   **requirements.txt**: Specifies all Python package dependencies required to run the project. This file is used by `pip` to install the necessary libraries.
*   **pytest.ini**: Configuration file for `pytest`. Used here to set options like the default asyncio loop scope to manage warnings and ensure consistent test behavior.
*   **.venv/**: Contains the Python virtual environment specific to this project. This directory is typically gitignored and includes installed packages and Python interpreter copies, ensuring project isolation.
*   **.docs/**: Holds project-related documentation files.
    *   **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Describes the overall architecture of the application, including components and their interactions.
    *   **FUNCTIONS.md**: Provides detailed explanations of important functions within the codebase.
    *   **LEARNING.md**: A collection of notes, insights, and learnings gathered during the development process.
    *   **SOLUTION.md**: This document, providing an overview of the project structure and file descriptions.
*   **.env**: Stores environment-specific variables, such as database connection strings, API keys, or secret keys. This file is gitignored to prevent sensitive information from being committed to version control.
*   **people.db**: The default SQLite database file used by the application when not running in test mode or when a specific `DATABASE_URL` is not provided via the `.env` file. This file is typically gitignored.

### app/ Directory

This directory contains the core logic of the application, structured into several modules:

*   **__init__.py**: An empty file that tells Python to treat the `app` directory as a package, allowing modules within it to be imported using `app.module_name`.
*   **database.py**: Handles all database-related setup. This includes defining the database URL, creating the SQLAlchemy engine, and managing database sessions. It provides functions to connect to and disconnect from the database.
*   **entities.py**: Defines the structure of database tables using SQLAlchemy's declarative base. Each class here typically represents a table in the database.
*   **models.py**: Contains Pydantic models used for data validation, serialization, and documentation. These models define the expected structure for API request bodies and response payloads.
*   **crud.py**: Implements the Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for the application's data. These functions interact directly with the database via SQLAlchemy, using the models defined in `entities.py` and `models.py`.
*   **mappers.py**: Provides utility functions to map data between different Pydantic models or between Pydantic models and SQLAlchemy ORM objects (entities). This helps in decoupling the API layer from the database layer.
*   **routes.py**: (Previously `app/routers/people.py`) Defines the API endpoints using FastAPI's `APIRouter`. Each function here corresponds to an API operation (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and handles incoming requests, calls appropriate CRUD functions, and returns responses.

### tests/ Directory

This directory houses all the automated tests for the application, ensuring code quality and correctness:

*   **__init__.py**: An empty file that makes the `tests` directory a Python package.
*   **conftest.py**: A special pytest file used to define fixtures, hooks, and plugins that are shared across multiple test files within this directory and its subdirectories. For example, it sets up the test database session.
*   **test_crud.py**: Contains unit tests specifically for the functions defined in `app/crud.py`. These tests verify that data is correctly created, retrieved, updated, and deleted from the database.
*   **test_database.py**: Includes tests for the database connection logic and utility functions in `app/database.py`. It ensures the database can be connected to and disconnected from correctly.
*   **test_mappers.py**: Contains unit tests for the data mapping functions found in `app/mappers.py`, ensuring that data transformations between different model types are accurate.
